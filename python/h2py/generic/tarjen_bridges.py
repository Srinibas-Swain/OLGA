    * Find a spanning forest of G
    * Create a rooted forest F from the spanning tree
    * Traverse the forest F in preorder and number the nodes. Parent nodes in the forest now have lower numbers than
      child nodes.
    * For each node v in preorder (denoting each node using its preorder number), do:
        * Compute the number of forest descendants ND(v) for this node,
          by adding one to the sum of its children's descendants.
        * Compute L(v), the lowest preorder label reachable from v by a path for which all but the last edge stays
          within the subtree rooted at v. This is the minimum of the set consisting of the preorder label of v, of the
          values of L(w) at child nodes of v and of the preorder labels of nodes reachable from v by edges that do not
          belong to F.
        * Similarly, compute H(v), the highest preorder label reachable by a path for which all but the last edge stays
          within the subtree rooted at v. This is the maximum of the set consisting of the preorder label of v, of the
          values of H(w) at child nodes of v and of the preorder labels of nodes reachable from v by edges that do not
          belong to F.
        * For each node w with parent node v, if L(w)=w and H(w)<w+ND(w) then the edge from v to w is a bridge.
